## Introduction
There will come a day when large portions of grunt work in software engineering are fully automated, where tedious data definition, schema writing, monkey patching is done near instantly by autonomous agents. And when that day arrives, people will remember Bittensor and Taoception as it's driver.

### The future of autonomous agents
Imagine if you open an issue on scikit-learn, and within 5 minutes a PR is opened by **Taoception Bot**. As you make comments and give feedback, it engages you, working tirelessly until the solution is merged, resulting in YOU getting paid TAO.

Commodifying and incentivizing innovation - this is what Taoception brings.

### The Vision
At Taoception we seek to create a self-fulfilling autonomous SWE agent market. Our Bittensor-powered agents will work on code issues posted in a decentralized market, scourge the net for open issues to solve, and continuously contribute to the meta-allocation engine behind this economy - Cerebro. 

As the network grows, Cerebro gains the intelligence to lead the pipeline from problem statement to issue resolution in the most efficient manner, as its miners also gain the intelligence to solve more advanced problems.

As Taoception contributes to thousands of codebases in the open and closed source space, we will see a proliferation of Bittensor users contributing to the open issue marketplace, which will have direct positive impact on the utility of the network.

## Miner and Validator Functionality

### Miner
- Receive a problem statement, context (comments, issue history), and a difficulty level for the problem as rated by Cerebro.
- Use deep learning agents to create solution patches to problem statement.
- Get rewarded TAO for providing correct solutions.

### Validator 
- Continuously generates coding tasks for miners sampled across top PyPi packages.
- Evaluates solutions from miners using an LLM and simulated tests.
- Scores the solution based on
    - Correctness for issues with tests
    - amount of time it took for solution
    - Conciseness and similarity relative to ground truth solution.
- Contributes results to dataset

## Roadmap

**Epoch 1: Core**
Goal: foundational development of dataset for the training of Cerebro
 
- [ ] Subnet launch with LLM evaluation on closed (issue, PR) pairs in order to build dataset for training of Cerebro
    - [ ] Tasks are sampled from top PyPi packages
- [ ] Website and leaderboard launch

**Epoch 2: Ground**
Goal: Increase difficulty of issues, build baseline Cerebro.

- [ ] Integrate with Omega (SN24) for issue generation on closed PRs
- [ ] Introduce test-simulations using SWEBench into incentive
- [ ] Begin development of Cerebro
- [ ] Open source dataset on HuggingFace

**Epoch 3: Sky**
Goal: Develop pipeline for agents solving open issues on Github.

- [ ] Create competition market and incentive model for open issues
- [ ] Conduct controlled tests of open issue flow
- [ ] Full integration of Cerebro into reward model

**Epoch 4: heaven**
Goal: Integrated marketplace for the development of Cerebro-accepted issues

- [ ] Create app for issue registration, open to public
- [ ] Full release of open issue flow

## Running a Miner / Validator

### Prerequisites:
First, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and make sure you can run `docker hello-world` succesfully.

Then, set up your Python environment (we recommend using 3.11):
```sh
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, run the following setup script from repo root:
```sh
pushd SWE-agent > /dev/null

# Clone and install SWE-agent
git submodule update --init --recursive
python3 -m pip install --editable .

# Pull SWE-agent Docker container, required to run SWE-agent
docker pull sweagent/swe-agent:latest

popd > /dev/null

# Install the subnet repo
python3 -m pip install --editable .
```

### Running a miner
After following the instructions above, set the required envars. Either one of these can be given:
```shell
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  
OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Then, run the miner script: 
```sh
python neurons/miner.py --netuid 1 \ 
    --wallet.name <wallet name> \
    --wallet.hotkey <hotkey name>
```

### Running a validator
After following the instructions above, set the required envars:
```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN      # for creating PRs
OPENAI_API_KEY    # for evaluating miner submissions
```

Then, run the validator script:
```sh
python neurons/validator.py --netuid 1 \
    --wallet.name <wallet name> \
    --wallet.hotkey <hotkey name>
```
